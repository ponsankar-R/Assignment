I parsed the JSON and decoded the y-values from their various bases into BigInts to prevent precision loss. To find the constant term without calculating the full polynomial, I used Lagrange Interpolation evaluated at $x=0$. To handle the fake points provided in the data, I generated combinations of $k$ points, calculated the y-intercept for each, and found the consensus answer. I also ensured all intermediate math was done using fractional logic so BigInt division wouldn't truncate the results prematurely
